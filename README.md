Transaction data was downloaded from a Rinkeby Network API. Only transactions where I was able to verifiably link a blockchain address to a Reddit username are displayed. This was done by cross-referncing the publicly available csv files provided by Reddit during each Moon distribution cycle.

All data used was collected from public sources. However, if you're a Redditor included in this visual and wish for your username to not be shown, send u/ominous_anenome a DM on Reddit and I'll do my best (time permitting) anonymize your name.
